# Semiclassical Nuclear Densities

This code evaluates the nuclear density distributions, together with the bond, angle, and dihedral distributions, given the wavefunctions determined with a [semiclassical method](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5041911), using a Monte Carlo approach. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes and reproduction of the distributions for protonated Glycine.

### Prerequisites

These instructions are given for a Linux system, where both gfortran and MPICH are installed.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
